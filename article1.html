        <h2> The Idea Of Beauty Is Always Shifting: An Inclusive View That The Disabled Community Is a Part Of Broad
            Society.</h2>


        <img class="img" src="/image/joseph-gonzalez-fdlZBWIP0aM-unsplash.jpeg" alt="">


        <p class="paragraph-1">Meta description: Have you ever been out in public and seen someone with a disability wearing make-up like
            mascara or lipstick? Did it make you wonder why they were wearing it? You might not realize it, but most
            people with disabilities feel insecure. "Insecure" doesn't mean the same thing as "unconfident". Rather than
            feeling like they are less than others, people with disabilities are often more introverted and might wear
            the cosmetic that makes them feel like confident. Cosmetics are one of the most popular forms of
            self-expression for people with disabilities - the same reasons anyone else would.

            Not many people are aware of the huge gap that exists in the cosmetics industry's product line with little
            to no options for those with disabilities and as a result of this fact, there are still many misconceptions
            about cosmetics concerning disability and those with differences.


        </p>

        <p>Yes, as simple as it sounds, cosmetics don’t always work for all people. Some people with disabilities don’t
            even have the chance to wear them, as they are inaccessible to them. Many people with disabilities need
            small-size cosmetics and products they can control. For example, lipstick always runs out of your hand and
            usually ends up being smeared on clothes. People with motor problems (for example, cerebral palsy) find it
            extremely difficult to put on lipstick themselves. With over 1 billion people in the world living with some
            type of disability, there’s clearly a big potential to address this problem.</p>

        <p>Ordana Mattioli, an expert in the cosmetics industry, states that "The makeup market is about $21 billion in
            the U.S. alone and trending up." This means that makeup is not going anywhere anytime soon.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Why do people who have disabilities wear cosmetics?

        </h3>

        <p>This may seem silly, but the comfort of a good foundation and lipstick can be invaluable when you feel like
            your body or abilities are different from everyone.

            Cosmetics are a fundamental part of a person's identity and expression- the way people perceive themselves,
            wearing cosmetics gives people with disabilities a little extra confidence boost - yet for many people who
            are disabled or differently-abled, that identity is impossible to achieve because they cannot use makeup.
            These barriers exist because of the limited research and development conducted by major beauty brands in
            regards to the cosmetics market approach to accessibility for disabled people.

            Until recently, many brands still did not even offer products that cater for all skin types, such as dry
            skin, oily skin and sensitive skin. These brands also provided different ranges of shades in terms of
            foundation, lipstick, concealer etc with standard foundations tending to be much too light for women with
            dark skin tones or olive complexions.
        </p>


        <p>Assistive technology(AT) tools have not been considered in designing products for people with disabilities.
            The majority of disabled individuals must navigate a world that isn't designed for them. Daily, they
            encounter physical and psychological challenges. Even frivolous, pleasant things in life like fashion and
            beauty are hard to assess.

            Yet, the beauty industry remains a realm exclusively created and designed for the able-bodied simply because
            of the lack of research into what appeals to this specific target market. However, with a greater push for
            women and individuals with disabilities to take their place as empowered individuals within society, more
            cosmetic brands will be pressed to re-imagining their offerings and communications to bring more
            marginalised communities into the fold.


        </p>

        <p>There is also a lack of awareness in regards to the wider disabled community market for cosmetics amongst
            the marketing companies. This is because of the belief that people with disabilities are not interested in
            their products, most AT companies are interested in targeting a niche market and tend not to advertise their
            products towards people living with disabilities. The result is that the majority of products marketed
            towards women with disabilities do not have any AT functions or features; which again adds to the difficulty
            that some women have when attempting to use makeup, especially when this is combined with the issues of
            products that cater for all skin types.</p>

        <p>The barriers that exist in the cosmetics market and its approach to accessibility for disabled people today
            are :</p>


        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>There is a lack of research into the wider application and appeal to this specific target market.
                </h5>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>Brands do not consider accessibility when designing products especially when AT devices are not
                    considered in regards to the design of their products.</h5>
            </li>


            <li>
                <h5>
                    The majority of products marketed towards women with disabilities do not have any AT functions or
                    features; which again adds to the difficulty that some women have when attempting to use makeup,
                    especially when this is combined with lighting issues.
                </h5>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>Products for making up have been around since ancient times. However, it's only within the last
                    century that cosmetics began to be marketed towards people with disabilities. Many people tend
                    to think that users with disabilities are not interested in cosmetics and this is why they don't
                    appear in makeup Ads. But this is far from reality</h5>
            </li>
        </ul>
